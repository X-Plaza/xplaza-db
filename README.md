# ecommerce-xplaza-DB

Database design and scripts for a fully fledged e-commerce business solution.

## Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts for initializing and managing the database of an advanced e-commerce platform. It includes:

- Schema definitions for all business entities (customers, orders, products, shops, etc.)
- Triggers and functions for audit/history (bin tables)
- Views for analytics and reporting
- Reference data (roles, modules, etc.)

## Files

- `ecommerce_xplaza_schema.sql`: Main install script for the e-commerce solution, including schema, triggers, views, and reference data.
- `ecommerce_xplaza_fresh_install.sql`: Alternative fresh install script with similar content and structure.

## How to Use

1. **Setup Database**
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database.
   - Run either `ecommerce_xplaza_schema.sql` or `ecommerce_xplaza_fresh_install.sql` using your preferred SQL client (e.g., `psql`, DBeaver, DataGrip).
2. **Reference Data**
   - All required reference data is included and will be inserted automatically.
3. **Customization**
   - Modify the scripts as needed to fit your business requirements (e.g., add new tables, adjust columns).
